    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Marinated Grilled Shrimp is a dish that brings the vibrant flavors of the
      coast to your plate. The shrimp are first marinated in a mixture of fresh
      lemon juice, garlic, and aromatic herbs like parsley or cilantro. This
      marinade infuses the shrimp with a bright, tangy flavor, while a touch of
      olive oil adds richness and helps the seasonings cling to every bite. Once
      marinated, the shrimp are skewered and grilled over an open flame, where
      they develop a slightly charred, smoky finish. The heat caramelizes the
      shrimp's natural sweetness, leaving the outside crisp and the inside
      tender and juicy. Each bite delivers a burst of citrusy, garlicky
      goodness, perfectly balanced by the subtle smokiness from the grill. It's
      a light yet flavorful dish, perfect for pairing with fresh salads or
      grilled vegetables, making it an ideal choice for a summer meal.
