    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is like a warm, comforting hug in the form of food. Imagine layers
      of flat pasta sheets stacked on top of each other, with each layer holding
      a rich and savory filling. The filling is often a mix of ground meat, like
      beef or sausage, cooked in a tangy tomato sauce. Some versions include
      creamy ricotta cheese, which adds a soft, velvety texture. These layers
      are topped with a generous amount of melted cheese, usually mozzarella,
      which becomes golden and bubbly when baked. The result is a hearty,
      flavorful dish with a perfect balance of textures—soft pasta, tender meat,
      and gooey cheese—all mingling together in every bite. Lasagna is a dish
      that fills you up and leaves you feeling satisfied, with each forkful
      offering a taste of home and tradition.
